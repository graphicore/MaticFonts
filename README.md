# Amatic SC Font Project
by Vernon Adams

<p>
Amatic SC (Small Caps) is a simple but effective hand drawn webfont.

<p>
Amatic SC can be used for titling and small runs of text.
It has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop
computers, laptops and mobile devices.

This project is a fork from the old Google font repository.
